# Final-Project

For the Final Project, I decided to build a model that can predict the type of power plant given a certain geography.

Some initial exploration.

Can climate zones be determined with atmospheric data, given a set of rules?

Can climate zones be determined with atmospheric data using cluster analyses?

If so, can those clusters be integrated into a larger atmospheric dataset to improve predictions on what type of power plant would be built given a certain geography?

I've used mostly NCEI data, with a couple of images obtained on the NASA website.
